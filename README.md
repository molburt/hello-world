# hello-world
This is my first project. Hooray.

I am allergic (or intolerant) to basically everything. Soy. Meat. Dairy. Egg. Caffeine. Sugar. Basically, I eat like a snobbish, diabetic vegan with a caffeine aversion. What do I eat, then, you ask? Mostly spaghetti. Like, 90% of my food is pasta of some kind. And I have to make the pasta myself. Oh, and the sauce. So yeah, don't every ask me out to dinner. We won't be able to go anywhere.
